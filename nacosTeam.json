  "content": "The NACOS Team, after fallingout unexpectedly at the SU Level Competition, they have gone back home to reinforce their team. They played well againts NUD and beat them 4:1 to proceed to the next stage of the NAPASS Competition. <p>The match was totally controlled by the Programming Boys of Computer Science and they played the team of NUD so well that the NUD boys got fraustrated at some points even very early in the first half.</p>  <p>Computer Science scored their goals through Ope (the team's captain), Solanki, David, and Abiodun while NUDâ€™s lone goal was notched by Yusuf.</p> <p>It will be another task for the Computer Science next time out, when they face Food Tech in just under a week - but we are certain, the team will get back to their winning ways. Until then, thank you for joining us - and have a great week!</p>",
